Hello everyone 👋! I've been wanted to have my own little space/blog on the internet for a long time,  and I'd like to give back to the community some of the knowledge it has given me. By «a long time» I mean a several years.

Why didn't I start earlier? (*reflection is coming*) There have always been two things holding me back:

- The **perfection**, which is something I always push to the limit, to the point where I never see anything as finished because there is always «a link in the chain that needs polishing». Although this may seem like a good quality, it is also a double-edged sword because no matter how much love I put into a post or project, I never see it as finished or polished enough to publish.

- The **uncertainty**, which comes somewhat inherited from the perfection. I don't like to make mistakes (as is logical) but it is something that is going to happend... I always ask myself: how I can be sure that what I want to publish is correct? What if I publish it and I'm wrong?

I think these questions have crossed the mind of anyone who is curious, especially if you work in the world of software development ([impostor syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome)). Over the years, I have realized thatn making mistakes is human and making mistakes is another way of learning (why else would we want a versions control system like *Git* if not to roll back in case of an error? 🤷‍♂️).

Another mental battle I used to have was: «Why start another blog when there are thousands of them on the internet?» Although at first glance this question might seem pointless, there are several reasons why I am interested in having my own blog:

1. To have my own digital footprint.
2. Learning by imparting knowlegde ➔ it is said that the best way to learn is by teaching, and in my case this is true. Despite of the fact that this blog is more focused on learning than teaching, if you learn with me, all the better.
3. Improve my english level in every post I write.
4. Fill in those breaks between sets at the gym (I wrote this entire post during breaks a couple of training sessions 😆).

Finally, I just wanted to mention that I'll write once I find a topic that I like and that adds value to the community. 😁

That said, if you've read this far, thank you for taking the time to read this, and have a great day. 🤙
